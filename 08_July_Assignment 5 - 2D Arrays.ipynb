To do this, we first turn array 2 in to the sorted list of the set of values in array 2. This means array 2 now only takes up size O(unique values in array 2) and is done in time O( n log n + N), where n log n is the sort process of the unique values in array 2 and N is the size of array 2 originally. We then also get the frequency of values in array 1 in time O(M) where M is the size of array 1. We then get the value of n as the length of the set form of array 2.\n",
